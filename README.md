# HTML 

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I'm documenting my journey of learning HTML for data analysis. If you're a beginner like me, this repository might help you get started.

## What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of web development. It's essential for creating web pages, which can be used to present and visualize data in your data analysis projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code).
- A web browser for testing your HTML code (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- A desire to learn and practice!

### Basics

- HTML documents are structured with tags, which are enclosed in angle brackets, like `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`.
- Content is placed between opening and closing tags. For example, `<p>My first HTML paragraph</p>`.
